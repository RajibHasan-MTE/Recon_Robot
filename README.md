# Recon Quadpad Robot 🤖

Welcome to the **Recon Quadpad** – an open-source, multi-terrain quadruped robot designed for **remote exploration, surveillance, and research** in unknown or hazardous environments.

This robot features:
- ⚙️ **Four-legged locomotion** for stability on rough terrains
- 🎥 **Live video streaming** for remote monitoring
- 📡 **Wireless control** using RF or Wi-Fi
- 🚧 **Obstacle detection and avoidance**
- 🔋 **Battery-powered with smart power management**
- 📦 Fully open-source hardware and firmware

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Design and build a flexible quadruped robot suitable for research and learning
- Encourage open-source robotics development
- Provide a base for students, makers, and engineers to build and expand upon

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Microcontroller: ESP32 / STM32 (customizable)
- Sensors: Ultrasonic, IMU, Gas (optional)
- Modules: Camera module, WiFi/Bluetooth, Motor drivers
- Platform: C/C++, Embedded C, Arduino, PlatformIO
